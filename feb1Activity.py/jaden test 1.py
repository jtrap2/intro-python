#1. What built-in function would you use if you wanted
# to print out data to a user?
the built in function would 

#2. What built-in function would you use if you wanted 
# a user to pass in data to a program? input

#3. Explain what complexity and abstraction are, then 
# provide an example describing their relationship to one another.
# You cannot use the following examples because they 
# were shared in class; grocery/ electronics store, car, phone. 
#Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
complexity is the measure  of  resources in a program while abrstrction is  the process of hiding complexity
#4. What does it mean when you encounter a syntax error?

#5. What is a variable? Provide an example of a variable in code.
a variable is  is  a place that is a holding space for a vulue that does a specfic code
String name = "John";

#6. Write a function in Python that when called will print out 
# your name.
# string = character,textnuber,words
# wrapped in quotation marks.
print("jaden harris")
print("jaden harris")
print(200+300+100)

#7. What is a function definition and a function call?
Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called. Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters.
#8. Describe what each symbol means?

# = // single equal
# == // double equal
# != // exclaimation equal

#9. What will the output for the following code block be?
var1 = 1
var2 = 2
var3 = "3"

print(var1 + var2 + var3)
the print would 1, 2, 3 

#10. What will the output for the following code block be?
listOne = [20, 40, 60, 80]
listTwo = [20, 40, 60, 80]

print(listOne == listTwo)
the codeblock would be 20, 40, 60, 80
# 11. Create the following python lists and include the following
# data types for each list:
# a- create a python list of strings. The strings should be items you
# can find in a book bag.
# b- Create a python list of floats. the floats should represent the 
# price of each item in a book bag from the previous list.
[pencils, paper, erasers, notebooks]

# 12. What are the Three (3) naming formats we use for naming variables, files, and functions?
letters undersores and discriptives
# 13. Provide a coding scenario where you would you use a comparison operator in a program?
 A example of a coding scenarion where you would use a comparison is if somebody has a membership and you have to see what memebership they have
# 14. Provide a coding scenario Where you would you use a logical operator in a program?
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:
# 15. Create a block of code where you would 
# use a comparison operator with the follwing data:
x = 5
y = 3

print(x >  y)

# Bonus : What does the type() function do?
The type() function returns the type of the specified object
