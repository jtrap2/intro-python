# i think that technology influenced people in a good way . I think that is has influenced people in a good way becuase it gives us shortcuts on many thing that might take us a long time for us humans to do  if we where to dod it are selfes. i
# for example without technology we wouldnt have  social media are the internet wich would make it harder to communicate  with others
# that could be bad becuaser there alot of influencers and famous people out the who use social media as outlet to inspire peope and show there acomplisments
#also technology influence people in a good way becuase  without technolgy we would habe not have the mediacl advancments we have now like covid 19 shot flu shots and more



# technology helps people learn becuase people learn diffrent and   with technology you can see diffrent people point of view and we can learn from that.
#not to mention technology make learning way easir with stuff like the computer to look up stuff  that we might not now in second, caculator so we dont have to figur out long quations and many more.
# technology helps with school becuas without it would have to write and read  for hour and this may be a personal matter but my hand cramps up alot when im writing so it helps my hand and readin books are cool and all but visual representation has shown to help alot of people learn thigngs
#lastly i think that technology helps people becuase it helps student and teacher communicated for example if you missing a assignment instead of trying to find ther all the time to keeep on asking tfor work you can email her wich is way more effecient
